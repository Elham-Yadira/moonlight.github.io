        <div class="text-wrapper">Everything is incredibly unique with you. I still remember the day I first saw you, It was 11th september and that day you were wearing a red colored check shirt but you didn't see me than.  Why you look so adorable on red? I used to think red only suits on women, but I was wrong. The interesting part is that I sometimes even forgot peoples name with whom I talked for hours but I still rember which shirt you wore at the very first day. <br><br><br>

            You know what, I have discovered many things about you from your social media activities. Perhaps your father is a teacher. Actually you wrote it one of your posts that teaching is in your blood and you're quiet fond of this proffesion, so I assumed it. You are a cute teacher. You look even more cute when you scold your students. If I'm not wrong you have a younger sister. Maybe Her name is Tanjina or something like that, right? Actually it was written on her birthday cake. You are a good brother.  One of your favorite food is yougurt. Sometimes you cook food by watching YouTube recipies, splendid. Congratulations on delay for your first research paper in 𝙄𝙣𝙩𝙚𝙧𝙣𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙖𝙡 𝘾𝙤𝙣𝙛𝙚𝙧𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙚 𝙤𝙣 𝘽𝙞𝙜 𝘿𝙖𝙩𝙖, 𝙄𝙤𝙏 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙈𝙖𝙘𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙚 𝙇𝙚𝙖𝙧𝙣𝙞𝙣𝙜 (𝘽𝙄𝙈 2021). You visited chitagong once by train. You also know how to play guiter. You are so creative. I wanted to know even more about you, but you removed your id and fb page. Hell with your facebook id & page, who cares. Hate you for this, you hear me, I hate you. Hey, why don't you unlock your id. You know, I will never comment on your posts again. Never ever. <br><br><br> 
            
            
            Hey, you guys are going to picnic, huh?. Will you take me with you?......... Just kidding. Tell me something,Who fills up a form for a picnic. Haha, You are so silly.   
             You know what ammu never allowed me to go for a picnic, never. But I terribly wanted to. Let alone a picnic she never allows me to go to my closest friend as well even today. I'm grown up now. But She still behaves like I'm a kid. This is pathetic. <br><br><br>
            
            Perhaps is was 2 november, You were passing through 4002 classroom. That time you looked at me, by giving me such a soft & inocent look you snatch my heart away from me. My heart was enchanted with that look. So I just wanted to get in touch with you as soon as possible. After a few minutes later, for the first time I sent you a friend request through Hafsa Moni (Jannat), it's still there and you don't even know. Otherwise, you would have blocked me ages ago. The same day I called you with the number I found on your cv and guess what? Johir sir recieved it, the same Johir sir who thinks I am an angel. Actually he was very fond of my quite and calm personality.  <br><br><br>
            
            
            You know what, I think that you visit my github profile on a regular basis. I don't have any evidence except my heart is telling me so. I just don't understand where the hell does these thoughts comes from.  Hell with my thougths.<br><br><br>
            
            
            
            I am a weird kind of person. I mean I'm very imature and super clumsy. I can't even talk properly.  I hate communicating with people. Whenever I am about to talk to new people, It gives me goosebumps. My brain turns Null (blank). When someone asks me somthing my brain says "UNDEFIENED".  I gives me soooooo much stress I can't afford. This is a great weakness  which is not acceptable at all in todays generation.<br><br><br>
            
             My home sweet home is like the world's heven for me. I can even stay here for years without stepping outside the house. I love my home, I love my bed. I don't even like to go outside for shopping as well. Do you  know,  I don't have any personal phone, let alone phone I don't have even a personal fb id & I don't know how to use it properly. Actually I never asked for a phone thus they never gave it and i never felt any neccesity for a personal phone. Whenever I need it I use my Ammu's phone. My favorite TV show is DORAEMON and GOPAL BHAR and my favorite is past time is watching youtube videos (specially cat rescue videos)  lying on the bed for hours. I'm obsessed with cats. I can watch cat videos all day long.  I talk with myself more than anyone else. I'm also very very very confused in desicion making. I don't know abc of makeup and not aware of latest fashion at all (Ami ekta Khet).   I'm preety good at creating mess. This is the only one task I can do properly except eating and sleeping. <br><br><br>
            
            
            
            
            
            
            People feels bore with me. They mocks at me by saying "You are sooooo boooooring. She doesen't know how to talk!" Sometimes they asks "Why don't you talk? Why are you so quite? Are you depresed or suffering from any kind of mental illness?". For their kind information, I'm absolutely fine. I hate them, hate them from the bottom of my heart. Whenever I am in a group or any kind of social gathering, I become invisible for them. They makes fun of me and I don't even know what to say in return.<br><br><br>
            
            
             I don't know whats gonna happen with my future hubby. How he is gonna bear my foolishness. I feel pity for him.<br><br><br>
            
            When I had you, I took you for granted. Now that you're gone,  I am  shedding tears for you.  But these tears are pretty useless now. I never knew it would mean that much.  What I felt for you never felt for anyone else before. Nobody gave me so much attention before. I never had someone starring at me, smiling for me. I never had anyone waiting on me. Nobody missed me before like you did. The way you used to observe me, none did that before. You are the only one for whom I shedded tears, you are the one for whom I make dua everyday in order to get you back in my life once again. You are the only one whom I truely admire from the core of my heart. <br><br><br>
            
            You won't believe, whenever I make dua for you a strange kind of peace peeks inside me as if my dua is already accepted or perhaps we are destinied to be togather. It just a matter of time and a little bit of patience. There is so much uncertainity in my life and I don't know why it feels like so but certainly whatever Allah will grant me in return of this dua will worth it and will be benificial for both of us inshaallah. I put my complete trust on Allah and let the rest of the situation handle him. This makes a lot of sense to me.<br><br><br>
            
            
            Wheather I get you or not, in my every dua I will always pray for you and your happiness. I have nothing to give you except this.....<br><br><br>
